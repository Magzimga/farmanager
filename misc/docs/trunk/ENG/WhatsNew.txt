    was smaller than the number of items in the history.

[-] Fixed the behaviour of Ctrl-Enter on non-existing items of edit/view
    history.

MultiArc - build 181
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[-] Saving and restoring of user defined command line switches in the archiving
    dialog did not work correctly.

[-] RAR.FMT: when using unrar.dll the archive password was passed to it in the
    wrong encoding.

Network - build 34
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[*] Fixed the following wrong behaviour: when the plug-in has been opened
    from a network directory and the user pressed Ctrl+PgUp from the
    Network providers list or tried to go up one level by any other way,
    they would have been confused because the current directory was a network
    one.

TempPanel - build 28
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[*] The plugin is now preloaded to memory when FAR is started so its functions
    may be used in other plugins.
