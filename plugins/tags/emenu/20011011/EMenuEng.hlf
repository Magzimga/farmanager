@Contents
$ #Windows Explorer context menu#
    This plugin allows you to execute Windows Explorer context menu commands
for the current file or folder on the FAR panel. The Explorer context menu is
the menu that is shown when you right-click a file or folder in the Explorer.
Therefore, this plugin allows you to continue using your favourite Explorer
shell extensions while working with FAR.

    The plugin can show a text or GUI menu, depending on its ~settings~@Config@.

@Config
$ #Windows Explorer context menu configuration#
^#Show message after execution#
 Enable this option if you want a message to be shown after the plugin has
finished working. This message may be needed under Windows 95/98, where
problems can arise if you execute some context menu commands in parallel
to working with FAR.

^#Show GUI menu#
 In the case when some commands cannot be executed from the text menu (this
is not a bug of the plugin but a Windows limitation), you can use the GUI menu.
The option can have one of the following values:

 #[ ]# Show the text menu
 #[x]# Show the GUI menu
 #[?]# Allow to choose the text or GUI menu every time when the plugin
     is invoked.

@Close
$ #Press "OK" to continue...#
    Some commands take a while to execute. Therefore, you should press #OK#
only after the command has completely finished processing. If you press #OK#
too early, some problems may arise.

    This message can be disabled in the plugin ~configuration dialog~@Config@.
