$ #Archive support plugin#
    This FAR module performs transparent #archive# processing.
Files in the archive are handled in the same manner as if they
were in a folder: when you operate with the archive, FAR
transforms your commands into the corresponding external
archiver calls.

@AddToArc
$ #Adding files to archive#
    In this dialog you may choose the archiver, add or change
command line switches (default switches may be defined using
~Archiver settings~@ArcSettings@ dialog), enter a password
to encrypt files during archiving.

    Option #Delete files after archiving# forces the archiver to move
rather than copy files.

    The #Save settings# choice saves the current archiver and switches
for future usage.

@ExtrFromArc
$ #Extracting files from archive#
    In this dialog you may enter the path to extract files and set the
password to decrypt archived files.

    Option #Extract without pathnames# forces extraction of all files
to the same folder.

    To immediately extract selected archived files to the current folder
you may also use #Alt-F6#.

@ArcCmd
$ #Archive commands#
    From this menu you can test archive, add an archive comment,
convert an archive to SelF-eXtracting (SFX), try to recover a
broken archive, protect an archive from damage or disable
archive modifications.

    Notes:

    1. To execute an archive management command you need to have
the corresponding archiver tool. Archiver options may be changed
in the ~Archiver settings~@ArcSettings@ dialog.

    2. The whole set of archive management commands may only be
used with RAR archives. Other archivers will support only a sub-set
of these commands.

@ArcCfg
$ #Archive support configuration#
    In this dialog you may change following parameters:

 #The way of archivers#   Do not hide archiver output,
 #output displaying#      hide for view operation or hide always

 #Process Shift-F1#       Add files to archives on Shift-F1.
 #command#                You may wish to disable this option
                        if you have another archive support plugin
                        installed, which processes Shift-F1 command.

 #Description list#       Names of files with descriptions of archived
 #names delimited#        files.
 #with commas#

 #Read archive#           Read descriptions of archived files
 #descriptions#           when entering to an archive. This enables
                        the viewing of descriptions but slows down
                        archive reading.

 #Update archive#         Update descriptions of archived files
 #descriptions#           after adding to or deleting from an archive.

@ArcSettings
$ #Archiver command lines#
    In this dialog you may change external archiver command lines
for different archive processing operations and mask, which will be
used to select all files.

    The following variables may be used:

 %%A - Archive name.

 %%a - Short archive name.

 %%W - Temporary folder including the terminating slash.

 %%P - Password.

 %%R - Current archive folder.

 %%L - Filelist name. Filelist is the file containing names of files
       to be processed by the external archiver.

 %%l - Filelist with short file names.

 %%F - Names of one or more files to be processed. If all names
       cannot be placed in a single string, the archiver will be
       executed several times until all file names are exhausted.
       By default maximum total command length is 127, but you can
       specify it directly after %%F, for example %%F512.
       Variable %%F should be used only if the destination archiver
       does not support filelists.

 %%f - The name of a single file to process. The archiver will be
       executed several times until all file names are exhausted.
       This variable should be used only if the destination archiver
       does not support filelists or multiple file names on
       the command line.

 %%E<errorlevel> - maximum acceptable command errorlevel.
       For example, %%E2 indicates that errorlevels 0, 1 and 2
       are acceptable. This variable may be specified in any place
       of command. If it is absent, only errorlevel 0 is considered
       as successful.

 %%S - Place in the command line to insert additional switches,
       specified in the second string of "Add" dialog. If this
       variable is absent, switches are added to end of command
       line.

    Variable modifiers Q, q, S, M, N, *, W, P can be used to change
file names format details:

    'Q' - quote names with spaces;
    'q' - quote all names;
    'S' - use '/' instead of '\' in pathnames;
    'M' - transfer folder names to archiver as 'foldername\*.*';
    'N' - transfer folder names to archiver as 'foldername';
    '*' - use '*' mask to select all files. This modifier
          overrides "All files mask" parameter for single
          archiver command;
    'W' - use name only, without path;
    'P' - use path only, without name;
    'A' - use ANSI encoding.

    These modifiers may be specified immediately after %%F, %%f, %%L
or %%l variables without spaces. 'P' and 'A' also may be used with
%%A and %%a. Several modifiers are allowed, for example %%LMN or
%%F*QSN128 are valid. If neither 'M' nor 'N' modifier is specified,
'N' is assumed. If both 'M' and 'N' are specified, both 'foldername'
and 'foldername\*.*' will be transferred to archiver.

    If a part of the external archiver command string is enclosed
in {  } braces, it will be added to the resulting string only
if this part contains at least one, non-empty variable,
from those described above.

    If an external archiver does not support a particular command,
leave the corresponding string blank.
